    <p>Welcome to the about me page where you get to learn a little bit about the creators. My names Austin and a few things I like to do are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Going on hikes.</li>
        <li>Watching anime.</li>
        <li>Watching videos about code.</li>
        <li>Skating around with friends.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sports are a great way to connect with various types of people around the world so why not learn a little more? I hope this page inspires whoever is looking at it to maybe try out a new sport with family/friends.</p>
